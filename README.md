# Book-Recommendation-System
Welcome to our Book Recommendation System project! This project utilizes collaborative filtering, k-means clustering, and k-nearest neighbor algorithms to provide personalized book recommendations to users.
## Overview
Our system analyzes user behavior and book attributes to suggest books that users are likely to enjoy based on their preferences and past interactions. By combining collaborative filtering techniques, k-means clustering for grouping similar users or books, and k-nearest neighbor for finding similar items, our recommendation engine offers accurate and diverse book recommendations.
## Features
1. Collaborative filtering: Recommends books based on user similarities and interactions.
2. K-means clustering: Groups users or books with similar characteristics to enhance recommendation accuracy.
3. K-nearest neighbor: Finds books similar to a given book or user preferences.
## Example
Here's a screenshot of our recommendation system.
